# Binary-Search-Tree-Practice
Work in Progress

**Objective**

The goal is to practice writing Bianary Search Trees. 

The Bianary Search Tree includes:

1. I will practice building a Node class / factory. That has an attribute for the data it stores as well as its left and right children.

2. I will practice building a Tree class / factory which accepts an array when initialized. The Tree class will have a root attribute which uses the return value of buildTree function.

3. I will practice writing a buildTree function which takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed.

4. The code includes a prettyPrint function to show the array in the terminal in a binary tree format. I got this code from The Odin Project lesson on binary trees.

5.
