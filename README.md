# Binary-Search-Tree-Practice
Work in Progress

**Objective**

The goal is to practice writing Bianary Search Trees. 

The Bianary Search Tree includes:

1. I will practice building a Node class / factory. That has an attribute for the data it stores as well as its left and right children.

2. I will practice building a Tree class / factory which accepts an array when initialized. The Tree class will have a root attribute which uses the return value of buildTree function.
