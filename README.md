# Binary-Search-Tree-Practice

**Objective**

The goal is to practice writing Bianary Search Trees. 

The Bianary Search Tree includes:

1. I will practice building a Node class / factory. That has an attribute for the data it stores as well as its left and right children.

2. I will practice building a Tree class / factory which accepts an array when initialized. The Tree class will have a root attribute which uses the return value of buildTree function.

3. I will practice writing a buildTree function which takes an array of data and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of Node objects appropriately placed.

4. The code includes a prettyPrint function to show the array in the terminal in a binary tree format. I got this code from The Odin Project lesson on binary trees.

5. I will practice writing an insert and delete function which accepts a value to insert/delete.

6. I will practice writing a find function which accepts a value and returns the node with the given value.

7. I will practice writing a levelOrder function which accepts another function as a parameter. The levelOrder function will traverse the tree in breadth-first level order and provide each node as the argument to the provided function. 

8. I will practice writing a height function which accepts a node and returns its height.

9. I will practice writing a height function which accepts a node and returns its height.

10. I will practice writing a isBalanced function which checks if the tree is balanced. 

11. I will practice writing a rebalance function which rebalances an unbalanced tree.

12. I will practice writing a driver script to tie it all together.
